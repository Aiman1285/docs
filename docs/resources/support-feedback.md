### Billing FAQs

#### I upgraded from a Plus to Premium plan but why was I charged the full price? 
When you upgrade from a Plus to a Premium plan, the full price of the Premium plan is charged, and the pro-rated credit from your Plus plan is calculated and will be applied towards the **next** invoice. 

For example, suppose you switch from Plus to Premium on July 15th, having initially subscribed to the Plus plan on July 1st. You'll be charged the full Premium price on July 15th and your Premium service will commence from that date. At the same time, we calculate and store a credit corresponding to the unused portion of your Plus plan. This credit will be applied to your next invoice (in this case, August 15th), reducing the overall charge for your Premium plan.

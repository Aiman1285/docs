Whether you're a developer, researcher, or enthusiast, this guide will provide you with the knowledge to leverage Dune AI's features for your projects.

## Getting Started

Before we dive into the examples, it's important to understand the basics of prompt engineering with Dune AI. Prompt engineering involves crafting questions or commands that guide the AI in performing specific tasks. A well-designed prompt results in more accurate and useful responses.

### Principles of Effective Prompting

- **Clarity**: Be clear and specific about what you're asking.
- **Context**: Provide enough context to guide the AI's response.
- **Conciseness**: Keep prompts concise to avoid overwhelming the AI.

## Capabilities Overview

Dune AI offers a range of capabilities, especially suited for blockchain analytics. Key features include:

- Parsing smart contracts to extract functions, variables, and more.
- Identifying and categorizing project names within blockchain data.
- Analyzing transaction patterns and detecting anomalies.
- Generating insights from blockchain data trends.

## Example Prompts

Below are examples of how you can structure your prompts to make the most out of Dune AI's capabilities.

### Parsing Smart Contracts

#### Example 1: Extracting Functions

**Prompt**: "List all functions within the XYZ smart contract and provide a brief description of each."

**Purpose**: This prompt aims to extract detailed information about the functions defined in a smart contract named XYZ.

#### Example 2: Identifying Variables

**Prompt**: "Identify all public variables in the ABC smart contract and explain their significance."

**Purpose**: To get an overview of the variables in the ABC smart contract and understand their roles within the contract.

### Identifying Project Names

#### Example 1: Project Categorization

**Prompt**: "Categorize the following project names by their primary blockchain technology: Ethereum, Solana, Cardano."

**Purpose**: This prompt helps in understanding which projects operate on which blockchain technology, assisting in trend analysis and market segmentation.

#### Example 2: Project Insights

**Prompt**: "Provide an analysis of the project named 'DeFiKingdoms' including its blockchain base, key features, and current market position."

**Purpose**: To gather comprehensive information about the project 'DeFiKingdoms,' including its technological foundation and market performance.

## Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

- **Iterate**: Don't hesitate to refine your prompts based on the responses you get.
- **Be Specific**: The more specific your prompt, the more targeted the AI's response will be.
- **Use Examples**: When possible, provide examples within your prompt to guide the AI's understanding.

## Conclusion

Dune AI is a powerful tool for blockchain analytics, offering detailed insights into smart contracts, project names, and much more. By mastering prompt engineering, you can unlock the full potential of Dune AI for your research or development projects. Happy prompting!

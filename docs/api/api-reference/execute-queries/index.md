!!! warning "Docs Migration"
    Our API docs have moved to [here](https://dune.mintlify.app/api-reference/overview/introduction), this reference page will be deprecated soon.

Learn how to execute an existing query and cancel the execution. For how to get query results (including knowing how big the result will be), please refer to [Getting Results](../../api-reference/get-results/index.md) section.

<div class="cards grid" markdown>
- [Execute Query via Query ID](../execute-queries/execute-query-id.md)
- [Cancel Execution](../execute-queries/cancel-execution.md)
</div>


!!! Tip 
    You can specify the `performance` level of executions (see example in [execute query id](../execute-queries/execute-query-id.md)).

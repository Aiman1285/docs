title: Uploading data
description: The Dune CSV Upload API allows you to upload csv files to Dune.

!!! warning
    Our API docs have moved to [here](https://dune.mintlify.app/api-reference/overview/introduction), this reference page will be deprecated soon.

**Easily upload your own data to Dune**

The Dune write API allows you to upload CSV files into the Dune database. This API streamlines the process of importing data into the Dune platform and allows you to import off-chain data into Dune with ease. You can simply use your usual API key to authenticate with the API and upload your CSV file.

Currently, the API only supports uploading CSV files with a maximum size of 200 MB. The API will return an error if the file size exceeds this limit. 

The files you upload will be queryable via the schema ``dune.team_name.dataset_name``. For example, if you upload a file called ``energy_data.csv`` to the team ``dune`` and name the dataset ``energy_data``, you will be able to query the data via ``dune.dune.energy_data``.

You'll be able to query for your data in any query.

```sql
Select * from dune.dune.dataset_energy_data
```

We automatically infer schemas (=detect datatypes) for all uploaded data. If in doubt, you can check the assumed datatypes in the information schema. 

```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'dune_upload' 
AND table_name = 'energy_data';
```

Anything that represents a timestamp is especially tricky for automated systems to detect, if something is not working as intended, try coverting the timestamp to ISO time before uploading and use the applicable TrinoSQL function to convert it back.

!!! Info
    All data uploaded is public and can be accessed by anyone.   
    Private data uploads are available only on the **premium plan.**


!!! Tip
    You can also upload data via the User Interface. Check out the [APP documentation](../../../app/upload-data.md) for more information.
## How to use the API

The write API allows you to upload any .csv file into Dune. The only limitations are:

- File has to be < 200 MB
- Column names in the table can't start with a special character or digits. 

Below are the specifics of how to work with the API.

### Authentication

To authenticate with the API, you must include your API key in the request headers. The header should look like this: 

``X-Dune-Api-Key : <your-api-key>``

### Endpoint

The API endpoint for uploading a CSV file is:

```
POST https://api.dune.com/api/v1/table/upload/csv
```

### Request Parameters

The request payload should be a JSON object containing the following fields:

- `table_name`: (string) The target table in the database where the CSV data should be uploaded.
- `description`: (string, optional) A brief description of the uploaded data. Will be displayed in the Dune UI in the future.
- `data`: (string) The content of the CSV file, passed as a string.
- `is_private`: (boolean, optional) Whether the data should be private or not. Private data is only available to the team that uploaded it. Defaults to `false`.


### Example Request

```json
{
    "table_name": "example_table",
    "description": "Sample data for testing",
    "data": "column1,column2\nvalue1,value2\nvalue3,value4" 
}
```

``"data"`` is simply the raw .csv data in this request. In "real" requests you would probably pass the data to this function inside of your local program instead. It might look something like this: ``"data": str(data)``.  

### Response

The API will respond with a status code indicating the result of the upload. A successful upload will return a 200 status code. The response body may contain additional information about the result of the request.

### Example Usage

You can test the API by forking this google colab notebook and bringing your own API key: 


- [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dJ9xTT5UfyylIUbMg9r-6FSeMD37HoZN?usp=sharing)

Alternatively, you can use the following Python code to do the same locally:

```py
# This example demonstrates how to use the new API to upload a CSV file
import os
import json
import requests

api_key = '<YOUR_API_KEY>'
csv_file_path = '<CSV_FILE_PATH>'

url = 'https://api.dune.com/api/v1/table/upload/csv'

with open(csv_file_path) as open_file:
    data = open_file.read()
    
    headers = {'X-Dune-Api-Key': api_key}

    payload = {
        "table_name": "example_table",
        "description": "test_description",
        "is_private": False,
        "data": str(data)
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers)

    print('Response status code:', response.status_code)
    print('Response content:', response.content)

```


## Querying for the data in Dune

Once the data has been uploaded, you can explore it in the my data section in the data explorer: 

![upload data](../../../app/images/upload_data.gif)

You can query for your data in any query.

```sql
Select * from dune.dune.dataset_energy_data
```

To check whether the datatypes are correctly inferred, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'dune' -- replace with your team name
AND table_name = 'energy_data'; -- replace with your dataset name
```


## Private data

If you don't want to share your data with the world, you can also upload private data. Private data is only visible to you and your team members. To upload private data, **you need to be on the premium plan**. If you are on the premium plan, you can upload private data by passing the ``is_private`` parameter in the request payload.

```json
{
    "table_name": "example_table",
    "description": "Sample data for testing",
    "data": "column1,column2\nvalue1,value2\nvalue3,value4",
    "is_private": true
}
```

Data uploaded with the ``is_private`` parameter set to ``true`` will only be visible to you and your team members. You can query it in the same way as public data and use it in public queries. However, the raw data will not be visible to anyone outside of your team.


You can also change the privacy settings of a dataset after it has been uploaded. To do so, go to settings -> data page and click on the three dots next to the dataset you want to change the privacy settings for. Then click on "make table private" to make the table private or "make table public" to make it public. 

## Deleting data

You can delete your data via your settings page.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: calc(61.25000000000001% + 41px); height: 0; width: 100%"><iframe src="https://demo.arcade.software/mr3mDEQl0qQi9e1H4HZB?embed" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;color-scheme: light;" title="Teams > Dune"></iframe></div>

1. Click on the "settings" button in the menu of the Dune UI.
2. Click on "data".
3. Find the dataset you want to delete.
4. Click on the three dots to open the options for the dataset.
5. Click on "delete dataset".
6. confirm the deletion.
7. The dataset is now deleted.


## Updating data

Currently there is no way to update the data of an already existing .csv file.
However, you can simply make a request to the API with the same ``table_name`` and replace the already existing file that way.

Another way to do this would be to use the "query a query" feature to query multiple .csv files at once.

For example:

```sql
--query_2441513

Select * from dune.dune.dataset_energy_data_1

UNION ALL

Select * from dune.dune.dataset_energy_data_2

-- add more as it becomes relevant
```

In your main query, you could then simply refer to this query.

```sql
Select * from ethereum.transactions t
left join query_2441513 q on q.address = t."from"
```


## Large Amounts of Data

If you want to share valuable off-chain data on Dune with your community, we are happy to discuss custom arrangements. Please reach indicate your interest via this [form](https://bit.ly/dune-data-integration).

This is only applicable for datasets with positive externalities for the Dune community. Examples include:

- [Farcaster](../../../data-tables/community/neynar/farcaster/index.md)
- [Reservoir](../../../data-tables/community/reservoir/index.md)
- [Flashbots](../../../data-tables/community/flashbots/index.md)

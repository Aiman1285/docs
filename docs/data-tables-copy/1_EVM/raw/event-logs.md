Event Log tables store all logs data that gets generated by smart contracts.

This can be useful for querying contracts that are not yet decoded or are not able to be decoded since the code of the smart contract is not public.

Logs are an elegant way to store tiny amounts of data on EVM blockchains for a small amount of gas. Specifically, event logs are useful to let other people know something has happened without them having to query contracts individually.

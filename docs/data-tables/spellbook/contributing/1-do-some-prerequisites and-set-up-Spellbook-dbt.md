description: Heres what you need to do to set up your computer to work on Spellbook.
---

To get started, you‚Äôll need to install:

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (any IDE will work but this is what we use)
* [Python 3.9](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) (you need this exact version of Python and distutils installed; if you have trouble ask for help in our [#spellbook Discord channel!](https://discord.com/channels/757637422384283659/999683200563564655))
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
* [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)
* [git and GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) (including authentication)

After that, you‚Äôll also need to:

* Make a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of the [spellbook repo](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook). Including cloning locally and adding an upstream. 
* Review Github‚Äôs [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) on how to make a pull request from a fork. 

Here‚Äôs a quick video showing how to make a fork of the Spellbook repo:

![type:video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wGGhgwUsersdvqq4YpDWRMRSgqd8l8Qd/preview)

Essentially you:

1. Go to the Spellbook repository and click the fork button at the top.
2. Copy the HTTPS URL of your fork
3. Open the folder that you‚Äôd like to store Spellbook in inside of VS Code
4. Open a terminal in VS code and enter `git clone [paste your URL here]`

Once you hit enter, you‚Äôll start downloading Spellbook, it‚Äôll take a few minutes.

## Setting up Spellbook dbt

Once you have a local copy of your Spellbook fork, it‚Äôs time to set up Spellbook dbt!

If it isn‚Äôt already, open your local copy of your Spellbook fork in VSCode, then open a terminal and enter `pipenv install`.

This will install the packages necessary to run Spellbook on your computer.

Once that installation is complete, run `pipenv shell` to activate your virtual environment.

Then `dbt init` to initialize dbt.

Enter these values in each of the prompts that follow:

```

1. Enter a number: 1 [choose databricks]
2. host (yourorg.databricks.com): . [enter ‚Äú.‚Äù]
3. http_path (HTTP Path): .
4. token (dapiXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX): [just hit enter at first]
    1. [1] use Unity Catalog
    2. [2] not use Unity Catalog
5. Desired unity catalog option (enter a number): 2
6. schema (default schema that dbt will build objects in): wizard
7. threads (1 or more) [1]: 2

```

Don‚Äôt run `dbt debug` this will fail as you don‚Äôt have (or need) the required credentials.

With this configuration saved, run `dbt deps` to install dependencies.

Here‚Äôs what this should roughly look like for you:

Finally, run `dbt compile`.

If that runs correctly your terminal should end with ‚Äúdone‚Äù and you should see the ‚Äútarget‚Äù folder in your sidebar

Lastly, run `git checkout -b workshop` to create a new, locally stored branch called ‚Äúworkshop‚Äù for doing the practice work in this guide.

Finally, run `git push -u origin workshop` to add or ‚Äúpush‚Äù your local ‚Äúworkshop‚Äù branch to your remote GitHub repository so we can eventually make our Spellbook pull request.
